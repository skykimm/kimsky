                GV60 comes with onboard Level 1 charger for easy charging at home. With the included connector, plug into a 120V household outlet and charge the vehicle at home overnight – it can take up to 68 hours for a full charge.

              <p class="text">
                If there is enough space and capacity, level 2 chargers can be installed at home and speed up the charging time. Usually Level 2 chargers take about 7 hours with maximum output of 11kwh. Customers can be introduced to Genesis Level 2 Charging for consultation. Most of the public charging stations are equivalent to Level 2 chargers.

                What keeps you away from going on a picnic on a hot summer day? Have you ever wished to have a electric fan with you to keep your heat away? With new technology, Vehicle to Load (V2L), you can make it happen.

              <p class="text">
                Vehicle to Load is a system that provides AC power to inside and outside of the vehicle using high voltage for driving to operate electronic devices. Pull over your car wherever you would like and connect your desired electronic devices – cooling fan, heater, coffee machine, laptop charger… - you name it! Multiple devices can be used at the same time as long as it does not exceed the maximum output.

              Reflecting Genesis’ first dedicated electric vehicle and Genesis’ design identity, the GV60, which represents “dynamic elegance,” stands out in a dynamic style that symbolizes sleek silhouettes and high performance like coupe. However, the appealing design of the GV60 is not just the part exposed to the outside. Delicate inside the vehicle body and invisible places such as PE room (engine room).

                Automobile design is generally divided into external design, internal design, and color material finish (CMF) design. However there are parts that can be easily disregarded because they cannot be easily identified with the eyes. Genesis GV60 shows luxurious details on those hidden areas such as PE rooms, hood inner panels, door inner panels, fender side covers, charging doors and housings, and is designed in consideration of functional purpose and formability, from the overall vehicle body to very small trims.

                GV60 contains luxurious materials and elegant sensibilities suitable for the luxury brand, and “G-Matrix,” Genesis’ unique design element, is applied throughout the whole design. In particular, the GV60’s body reflects the concept of “New Urban Icon.” This is the main design keyword of the Genesis Mint Concept, which was unveiled in 2019, and contains unique shapes, functional forms, and concise yet intense design elements found in the latest design trends. The GV60 expanded these design elements to the details and carefully designed them to be invisible to further enhance their completeness.

                The PE room of the GV60 was inspired by mechanical aesthetics originating from the constructivism of Netherlands’ De Stijl and Bauhaus in the 1910s. As most PE rooms consist of functional parts, ideas were obtained from functional-based formulations and designed to harmonize with surrounding parts as much as possible. Since PE rooms consist of various functional parts, there are much more design restrictions such as pedestrian protection laws, weight, and durability than other design fields. Therefore, securing performance was considered first, and the styling of the GV60 was reflected as much as possible by organically collaborating with the Genesis Design Office.

                Genesis cared not only about the car structure but also about tires for driving sense and safety. Developed exclusively for electric vehicles through technical cooperation with Michelin and maximized driving performance by reflecting the next generation EV tire technology. Electric cars weigh more than regular gasoline vehicles because of batteries. In addition, since there is no engine noise, even smaller noise can be heard louder than usual. To withstand high torque and high load by reflecting the characteristics of electric vehicles, the rigidity and grip of tire tread were newly developed for electric vehicles only, and a resonance sound reduction sponge was used for an extremely quiet driving sense.

                Genesis’ Bang & Olufsen sound system is the 
                first high-resolution audio system to be 
                certified for high-resolution audio. High-

                that tests and verifies to meet the strict

                The Bang & Olufsen sound system plays the highest level of sophisticated sound through 17 speakers in the vehicle and combines advanced sound technology with Bang & Olufsen’s unique sound design sense to provide Genesis drivers and passengers with unique listening experience and true high-end sound. The multi-core center speaker located on the front dashboard and the surround speaker located on the rear C pillar not only provide harmonious sound blending (acoustic 
                combination) but also provide a stable sense 
                of space through a wide sound stage (sound 
                field), and the woofer located on the door delivers dynamic and powerful sound. In particular, OCS (Open Connected Subwoofer), 
                located in the trunk, is an innovative low-
                pitched reproduction system that maintains 
                the minimum size and weight of the sound 
                system and maximizes dynamic low-pitched 
                performance.

                passengers by removing unwanted road noise. 
                Software-based ANC-R technology, which was

                and expanded to Genesis G80 model and 
                GV60 in 2021, improves the overall in-vehicle

                In addition, the Electric Active Sound Design 
                (e-ASD), which plays virtual engine sounds
